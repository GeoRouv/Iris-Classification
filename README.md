# Iris-Classification

The Iris Flowers dataset is a very well known and one of the oldest and simplest for machine learning projects for beginners to learn. With this project, learners have to figure out the basics of handling numeric values and data. Data points include the size of sepals and petals by length and width. Using machine learning, a successful project classified irises into one of three species.
